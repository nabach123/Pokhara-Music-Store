<description>One of the best songs Bieber has ever released,
 “Anyone” puts an exclamation point on his personal 
and musical rebirth. The rose-colored glasses are off
 in this vulnerable and raw love song, which intertwines 
doubt that “You say that I won't lose you, but you can't
 predict the future, 'cause certain things are out of 
our control” with the simple certainty that “forever's 
not enough time to love you the way that I want.”
